Model, View, ViewModel concept

Model(Data) <--> ViewModel(javascript) <--> View(DOM)
ViewModel is similar to Octopus, it is the thing that connects and seperates the model from the view.
Declarative Bindings: By putting Bindings in HTML(DOM), Knockout connects DOM and ViewModel. (No need to program seperate connections in ViewModel anymore)
Automatic UI Refresh: Knockout(AKA KO) updates the view sutomatically when the model changes.
Dependency Tracking: Models can depend on other models, and KO updates it autometically when it changes.
