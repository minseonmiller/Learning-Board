Observables are just objects with special functions on them.

Example of Observable to keep track of favorit numbers.

var favNum =ko.observable(42) --> pass in initial value of 42 when we create an observable with Knockout.
favNum() --> if we want to get 42, just run it without argument.

If I change num to 43, the view have no way of knowing that has been changed.
We didn't actually run any code yet.

Knockout made you to run a function in order to change the value, so it updates autometically.
favNum(43) --> it changes value stored in Model and runs some special code to notify Viewmodel and let it know which part of view has to be changed.
favNum() --> it returns 43

Back before, we had to call view.render() anytime something is changed.
